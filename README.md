# CITES Wild-Sourced Animal Trade Analysis

The international trade of wild animals is a complex global activity. While it supports livelihoods, it also poses serious risks to biodiversity and species survival. The **Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)** regulates and monitors wildlife trade.  

This project focuses on **wild-sourced animals** — species taken directly from their natural habitats — analyzing trade volumes, patterns, and major countries involved to identify trends, assess risks, and provide insights for sustainable and ethical wildlife trade management.

## Problem Statement
Despite CITES regulations, wild-sourced animal trade continues to exert pressure on species and ecosystems. Limited visibility into key species, trading countries, and evolving trends hinders effective enforcement and conservation prioritization.  

This project analyzes CITES trade data to identify trends, key species, major trading countries, distribution of trade pressures, and ethical concerns.

## Objectives
- **Measure Trade Volumes and Trends:** Analyze transaction counts of wild-sourced animals (2019–2023).  
- **Identify Key Species and Leading Countries:** Determine the most traded species and major exporters/importers.  
- **Monitor Distribution of Trade Pressures:** Assess pressure across species and origin countries.  
- **Conduct Risk Assessment:** Evaluate potential risks using **Purpose Code**, **CITES Appendix**, and specimen categories.  
- **Highlight Ethical Concerns:** Focus on trophy hunting and high-risk transactions.  
- **Provide Practical Insights:** Support sustainable and ethical wildlife trade management.

## Key Findings & Insights
1. **Trade Volumes and Trends**  
   - Global trade is relatively stable with slight decrease over 2019–2023.  
   - **Reptiles** are most traded, followed by Corals, Mammals, Birds, and Sharks & Rays.  
   - Most trades involve **Manufactured Products (36.8%)**, **Live Specimens (33.5%)**, and **Raw Body Parts (21.5%)**.  
   - **Commercial purposes** dominate (68.8%), while hunting trophies account for 12.6%.  
   - **Arab countries contribute 8.1% of global trade** as exporters or importers.

2. **Key Species and Leading Countries**  
   - Top species: **American Alligator, Asian Water Monitor, Asian Python, Nile Monitor, Lama Vicugna**.  
   - **United States** is the largest importer; **Indonesia and Australia** are the largest exporters.  
   - **Arab countries (UAE, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Oman)** are active exporters.

3. **Distribution of Trade Pressures**  
   - Trade pressure is concentrated on certain species and origin countries.  
   - **American Alligator** represents 8% of global trade; Mammals face highest pressure from trophy hunting.  
   - Key origin countries: Indonesia, Australia, United States, Canada, South Africa; Arab region trade is localized but significant for specific species.

4. **Risk Assessment**  
   - Majority of transactions are **Medium risk (85%)**, **Critical risk 5%**, **High risk 2%**.  
   - Risk is concentrated among high-volume exporters and high-demand species, including in the Arab world.

5. **Ethical Considerations**  
   - Trophy hunting heavily impacts mammals (91.4% of hunting trophy transactions).  
   - Species under high ethical concern: **African Elephant, Hippopotamus, Chacma Baboon, Giraffe, Nile Crocodile, American Alligator**.

## Recommendations
- Strengthen monitoring and transparency in trade.  
- Prioritize protection of high-risk species and trophy-hunted mammals.  
- Focus on regional conservation priorities, including Arab countries.  
- Integrate risk-based decision making for enforcement.  
- Enhance regulatory enforcement globally and optimize CITES permit allocation.  
- Raise awareness and build capacity for ethical wildlife trade.  
- Address ethical concerns related to trophy hunting and high-demand commercial species.
