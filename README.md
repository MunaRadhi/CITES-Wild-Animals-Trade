# CITES Wild-Sourced Animal Trade Analysis

The international trade of wild animals is a complex global activity. While it supports livelihoods, it also poses serious risks to biodiversity and species survival. The **Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)** regulates and monitors wildlife trade.  

This project focuses on **wild-sourced animals** — species taken directly from their natural habitats — analyzing trade volumes, patterns, and major countries involved to identify trends, assess risks, and provide insights for sustainable and ethical wildlife trade management.

## Problem Statement
Despite CITES regulations, wild-sourced animal trade continues to exert pressure on species and ecosystems. Limited visibility into key species, trading countries, and evolving trends hinders effective enforcement and conservation prioritization.  

This project analyzes CITES trade data to identify trends, key species, major trading countries, distribution of trade pressures, and ethical concerns.

## Objectives
- **Measure Trade Volumes and Trends:** Analyze transaction counts of wild-sourced animals (2019–2023).  
- **Identify Key Species and Leading Countries:** Determine the most traded species and major exporters/importers.  
- **Monitor Distribution of Trade Pressures:** Assess pressure across species and origin countries.  
- **Conduct Risk Assessment:** Evaluate potential risks using **Purpose Code**, **CITES Appendix**, and specimen categories.  
- **Highlight Ethical Concerns:** Focus on trophy hunting and high-risk transactions.  
- **Provide Practical Insights:** Support sustainable and ethical wildlife trade management.

### 1. Trade Volumes and Trends
- Global trade levels of wild-sourced animals are relatively stable, with a slight decrease over the five years (2019–2023).  
- **Reptiles** are the most traded group, followed by **Corals**, **Mammals**, **Birds**, and **Sharks & Rays**.  
- Transaction types show that most trades involve **Manufactured Products (36.8%)**, **Live Specimens (33.5%)**, and **Raw Body Parts (21.5%)**, while Food Products and Processed Materials are minor contributors.  
- **Commercial purposes** dominate the trade (**68.8%**), whereas **hunting trophies** account for **12.6%** of total transactions.  
- **Arab countries are involved in 8.1% of global trade** either as exporters or importers.  
- **Bahrain's trade** is largely medium risk (**94%**), with Critical (**4%**), High (**1%**), and Low (**1%**) risk transactions.  

**Insight:** Global trade is substantial and concentrated in specific animal groups and transaction types, and Arab countries contribute a measurable share, highlighting stable demand patterns with slight decreases. Bahrain follows the same risk pattern as global trends, predominantly medium risk.

### 2. Key Animals and Leading Countries
- Top traded species include **American Alligator**, **Asian Water Monitor**, **Asian Python**, **Nile Monitor**, and **Lama Vicugna**.  
- The **United States** is the largest importer, while **Indonesia and Australia** are the largest exporters.  
- **Arab countries such as UAE, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Oman are active exporters**, contributing to regional trade dynamics and demonstrating their role in the global wildlife trade.  
- **Bahrain imports** top species:  
  - **American Alligator (57 transactions)**  
  - **Asian Water Monitor (34)**  
  - **Asian Python (26)**  
  - **Nile Monitor (18)**  
  - **Stony Corals (13)**  
- **Bahrain's top exports** include:  
  - **American Alligator (9)**  
  - **Asian Water Monitor (4)**  
  - **Asian Python (3)**  
  - **Nile Crocodile (3)**  
  - **Black-headed Parrot (2)**  

**Insight:** Trade is concentrated in a few species and leading countries, including key Arab exporters. Bahrain shows measurable activity in both imports and exports, indicating its contribution to regional trade dynamics.

### 3. Distribution of Trade Pressures
- **Reptiles experience strong commercial demand**, particularly for leather products and live specimens.  
- **American Alligator alone represents 8% of total global trade**, indicating significant pressure on this species.  
- **Mammals face the highest pressure from trophy hunting**, especially elephants, hippos, large primates, and crocodiles.  
- Trade pressure is uneven globally, with key origin countries like **Indonesia, Australia, United States, Canada, and South Africa** carrying disproportionately high volumes and environmental sensitivity.  
- In the **Arab world, species like American Alligator, Nile Monitor, and Asian Python are the most traded**, highlighting localized pressure even in low-volume regional markets.  
- **In Bahrain**, reptiles dominate trade pressure with American Alligator and Nile Monitor at the top, followed by Asian Python and Asian Water Monitor. Stony corals also contribute to pressure on marine species.  

**Insight:** Trade and environmental pressure are concentrated among certain species and origin countries, including Arab regions and Bahrain specifically, emphasizing areas where species are at risk of overexploitation.

---

### 4. Risk Assessment
- Most transactions occur under **Medium risk (85%)**, while **Critical risk represents 5%** and **High risk 2%**.  
- Risk is concentrated among **high-volume exporters** and **high-demand species**, requiring targeted monitoring.  
- Arabian world trade shows similar risk patterns, with 85% of transactions Medium risk, 5% Critical, and 2% High, highlighting that trade within or through Arab countries follows global risk trends.  
- **Bahrain mirrors this distribution**, with Medium risk (**94%**), Critical (**4%**), High (**1%**), and Low (**1%**) transactions.  

**Insight:** The distribution of risk percentages indicates priority areas for monitoring, particularly in regions with high trade volumes or sensitive species. Bahrain’s trade aligns closely with global and regional risk patterns.

### 5. Ethical Considerations
- **91.4% of hunting trophy transactions involve mammals**, reflecting substantial pressure on this group.  
- **Trophy hunting accounts for 49% of mammal trade**, raising ethical concerns about recreational or personal hunting.  
- Species most affected include **African Elephant, Hippopotamus, Chacma Baboon, Giraffe, and Nile Crocodile**.  
- **American Alligator, elephants, and hippos are under disproportionate trade pressure** due to both commercial and trophy hunting.  
- **Bahrain’s trophy hunting share is 0.12%**, whereas the wider **Arab countries account for 2.31%** of trophy trade transactions, showing that the region participates in hunting activities but at relatively low levels.  

**Insight:** Trophy hunting and high-volume commercial trade raise ethical and conservation concerns, particularly for mammals and specific high-demand species. Bahrain contributes a minor share to regional trophy hunting, but monitoring is still essential for species protection.


## Recommendations
- Strengthen monitoring and transparency in trade.  
- Prioritize protection of high-risk species and trophy-hunted mammals.  
- Focus on regional conservation priorities, including Arab countries.  
- Integrate risk-based decision making for enforcement.  
- Enhance regulatory enforcement globally and optimize CITES permit allocation.  
- Raise awareness and build capacity for ethical wildlife trade.  
- Address ethical concerns related to trophy hunting and high-demand commercial species.
